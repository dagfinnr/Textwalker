h1. Textwalker

h2. What?

Textwalker is a simple object-oriented library that searches and manipulates text in a way similar to word processors.

You can search backwards and forwards in the text, bookmark parts of the text, get text between bookmarks.

demo.php is a simple example that can be run from the command line. It extracts links and titles from slashdot.html,
which is an arbitrary snapshot of the Slashdot front page.

h2. Why and when?

This is an old experimental project that I've had lying around for years. I have no idea whether it might be useful.
