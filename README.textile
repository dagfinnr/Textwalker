h2. What?

Textwalker is a simple object-oriented library that searches and manipulates text in a way similar to word processors.

You can search backwards and forwards in the text, bookmark parts of the text, get text between bookmarks.

h2. Why and when?

This is an old experimental project that I've had lying around for years. I have no idea whether it might be useful.
